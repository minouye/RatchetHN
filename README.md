RatchetHN
=========

RatchetHN is an iOS friendly HackerNews frontpage, built with [Ratchet](http://maker.github.com/ratchet/). It relies on the 
[Unofficial Hacker News JSON API](http://hndroidapi.appspot.com/) for data.

I recently came across the Ratchet framework for quickly prototyping iPhone layouts and wanted to give it a try. 
RatchetHN is a simple attempt at recreating the HackerNews front page in an iOS friendly layout. Total time to implement 
was less than an hour or two.
