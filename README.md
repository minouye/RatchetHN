RatchetHN
=========

iOS friendly HackerNews frontpage, built with Ratchet.

I recently came across the Ratchet framework for quickly prototyping iPhone layouts and wanted to give it a try. 
RatchetHN is a simple attempt at recreating the HackerNews front page in an iOS friendly layout. Total time to implement 
was less than an hour or two.
